# Breaking changes
- Composer name changed from `blurcreative/elysium-slider` to `fyrst/elysium`. `blurcreative/elysium-slider` is still available in the `replace` section of composer.  
If the plugin is currently installed with the composer package `blurcreative/elysium-slider`, you can run `composer req fyrst/elysium` to switch.
