## Maximum Design Freedom for Shopping Experience  
With the Elysium plugin, you get maximum freedom for designing your Shopping Experience. The specially developed Elysium sections allow you to arrange your content in a fully responsive and flexible way – without rigid layout blocks. Using drag-and-drop, you can adjust column widths, combine rows, and intuitively change the order of your content in the Shopware editor.

## Versatile Slide Builder  
The integrated slide builder allows the creation of versatile, responsive, and reusable slides – from simple image banners to complex SEO-optimized content with headlines, descriptions, and links. You can also include videos, colors, gradients, or products and present them visually appealingly – all without design or programming knowledge.

## Slider and Banner Elements for Shopping Experience  
Using the Elysium slider and banner elements, you can directly use created slides in your Shopping Experience. These elements offer extensive configuration options, such as the number of visible slides, navigation, or display on different devices.

## Mobile-First and Device-Optimized  
Thanks to mobile-first device settings, the layout automatically adapts to smartphone, tablet, and desktop views – with minimal maintenance effort. Settings are inherited from the mobile view and only need to be maintained separately in exceptional cases.

## Expandable and Linkable Content  
Slides can be linked with products, individually extended via additional field sets, or defined as custom templates using Twig files. Additionally, you can create individual links per slide – as a button or fully clickable surface.

## Optimized for Performance and SEO  
For optimal performance, the plugin is Lighthouse-optimized: images are embedded via the picture tag, with lazy loading and fixed aspect ratios to avoid layout shifts. SEO-relevant content such as H-tags and structured banners can also be used in a targeted manner.
