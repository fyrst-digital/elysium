# Fix: Button color preview in slide builder
* Slide preview now correctly displays button colors (primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, link)
* Outline button variants are now properly rendered with border and transparent background
* Button sizes (sm, md, lg) are now reflected in the slide preview
