# Version 3.1.0

## Changelog
- Improvement: When saving a slide, the cache of all Shopping Experience layouts that have an Elysium element assigned to them is now invalidated. This means that changes to the slide are immediately visible in the storefront without having to delete the cache
- Bugfix: Prevent breaking overflow in cms two-col block
